- Process for problem solving
- Read the problem twice to understand it - ask clarifying questions)
- Try think basically of different ways to solve problem
- Think end-to-end (E2E) of the best solutions based on complexity
- Write the Algorithm from patterns in drawing
- Code it out

- Go through other solutions (even if you answered correctly).
_ Code should always be readable, ignore one liners
